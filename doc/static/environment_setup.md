# Environment Setup for Developing QML Plugins

To ensure a smooth development experience when developing plugins for IRBCAM, you should set up your development environment properly. This guide will walk you through the recommended steps to prepare your environment for creating, testing, and running QML plugins.

## Choosing an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

To develop QML plugins efficiently, we recommend using an integrated development environment (IDE) that can help you write, debug, and lint QML files. Several IDEs are suitable for QML development, including:

- **Qt Creator**: A popular choice among QML developers, Qt Creator offers features like QML linting, code highlighting, and debugging capabilities. It provides a comprehensive development environment for Qt-related projects.

- **Visual Studio Code**: An open-source code editor with a wide range of extensions, including QML support. It offers syntax highlighting, linting, and debugging features, making it a versatile option for QML development.

- **Other Text Editors**: If you prefer lightweight options, text editors like Vim, Sublime Text, or Notepad++ can also be used with QML plugins.

Choose an IDE that best suits your development preferences and needs. Many of these tools offer QML support and can enhance your development workflow.

## Loading QML Plugins into IRBCAM

Once you've set up your IDE, you can start creating QML plugins for IRBCAM. Here's how to load your QML plugins into the application:

1. Open IRBCAM: Launch the IRBCAM application on your development machine.

2. Access Plugin Settings: In IRBCAM, navigate to the "Plugins" menu.

3. Add a New Plugin: Select "Plugin Settings" and then choose "Add" to add a new plugin.

4. Select Plugin File: In the dialog that appears, browse to and select your QML plugin file. This file should contain the QML components and functionality you've developed.

5. Load the Plugin: After selecting your plugin file, IRBCAM will dynamically load the plugin.

6. Start Using the Plugin: Once the plugin is loaded, you can start using it within IRBCAM. Your QML components and features are now available for use.

Please note that the specific steps for loading QML plugins may vary depending on the IRBCAM version and configuration. 

With your environment properly set up, you can now focus on creating and testing QML plugins to enhance the functionality of IRBCAM.
