# IRBCAM plugins

IRBCAM wraps plugins in a QML Popup which is resized automatically to it's content. See [the documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qml-qtquick-controls2-popup.html#popup-sizing) for details. Therefore, it is recommended to base the plugin on a dynamically sized item, such as a [layout](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qml-qtquick-layouts-layout.html).
